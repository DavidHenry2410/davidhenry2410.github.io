excerpt: Welcome to my blog!

Firstly, I'd like to thank you for visting my blog! I have been telling myself I would get this created and some articles written up for quite a while, but I'm finally doing it. I have no formal guidelines on what I'll be posting, as my interests and expertise stretch across quite a few topics. That being said, it is safe to assume I will be posting about technology, cybersecurity, programming, and how all three intermingle. I have found plenty of other blogs online that have helped me tremendously in growing my skills, so I am happy to try to give back to the world. 

Thanks for visiting, and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to my via one of my contact methods in the site header.
